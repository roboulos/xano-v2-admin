# fn-8-7q5.5 Fix dashboards2.0 TypeScript lint warnings

## Description

Fix TypeScript lint warnings and remaining lint errors in dashboards2.0 after entity fixes.

**Size:** M
**Files:** dashboards2.0/app/**/\*.ts, dashboards2.0/lib/**/\*.ts

## Error Types

- TypeScript compiler warnings
- `@ts-nocheck` usage in legacy files (remove or fix underlying issues)
- Unused variables
- Missing type annotations

## Approach

1. Run lint after task 4 to get remaining errors
2. Fix in priority order:
   - Compiler warnings (may indicate bugs)
   - Unused variables (simple deletions)
   - Type annotations (add explicit types)
3. For `@ts-nocheck` files, evaluate if underlying issues can be fixed

## Key Context

- Some legacy files use `@ts-nocheck` - evaluate case by case
- Unused variable removal is safe
- Type annotations improve maintainability

## Acceptance

- [ ] `pnpm lint` exits with 0 errors in dashboards2.0
- [ ] Build still passes
- [ ] No runtime regressions

## Done summary

TBD
