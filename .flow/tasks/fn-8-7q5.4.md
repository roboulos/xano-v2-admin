# fn-8-7q5.4 Fix dashboards2.0 React unescaped entity lint errors

## Description

Fix React unescaped entity lint errors in dashboards2.0. These are the majority of the 985 lint errors.

**Size:** L → Split into batches by directory
**Files:** dashboards2.0/app/**/\*.tsx, dashboards2.0/components/**/\*.tsx

## Error Type

```
error  `'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&#39;`, `&#x27;`  react/no-unescaped-entities
error  `"` can be escaped with `&quot;`, `&#34;`, `&#x22;`  react/no-unescaped-entities
```

## Approach

1. Run lint to get full error list
2. Use sed/replace to fix common patterns:
   - `don't` → `don&apos;t`
   - `it's` → `it&apos;s`
   - `"quoted"` → `&quot;quoted&quot;`
3. Target high-frequency files first
4. Run lint after each batch to verify

## Key Context

- These are display strings, not logic - low risk of breaking
- Use regex replacement for efficiency
- Check git diff before committing each batch

## Acceptance

- [ ] Zero `react/no-unescaped-entities` errors in dashboards2.0
- [ ] Build still passes after all changes
- [ ] No visible rendering issues in UI

## Done summary

TBD
