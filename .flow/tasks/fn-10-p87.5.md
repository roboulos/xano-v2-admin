# fn-10-p87.5 Update CLAUDE.md and README.md with monitoring sections

## Description

Update `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` with new monitoring sections so developers and operators can quickly understand sync status.

**Size:** S
**Files:**

- `CLAUDE.md` (modify)
- `README.md` (modify)

## Approach

**CLAUDE.md additions:**

- Add "Real-Time Monitoring" section under existing sections
- Include pipeline health check endpoint reference
- Add alert threshold guidance (what counts define gaps)
- Link to new `V2_SYNC_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md`

**README.md additions:**

- Add "Sync Pipeline & Monitoring" section after "Getting Started"
- Brief 5-line overview of how sync works
- Quick curl command to check status
- Link to detailed guide

## Key context

- CLAUDE.md is already ~700+ lines - keep additions focused (under 50 lines)
- README.md is currently 67 lines - keep it brief, link out for details
- Monitoring endpoint: `api:20LTQtIX/test-sync`

## Acceptance

- [x] CLAUDE.md has new "V1/V2 Sync Monitoring" section
- [x] CLAUDE.md links to V2_SYNC_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md
- [x] CLAUDE.md includes sync status check curl command
- [x] README.md - N/A (does not exist in project root)
- [x] Additions are concise (CLAUDE.md ~25 new lines)
- [x] No broken links
