# fn-15-07t.3 Record Census Tab - V1 25.4M record visualization with migration scope

## Description

Build the Record Census tab at `components/ecosystem/record-census-tab.tsx`. Visualizes the V1 workspace's 25.4M+ records by category, shows migration scope analysis (what needs migration vs operational/logs), and displays V1->V2 sync progress.

### Implementation

**File:** `components/ecosystem/record-census-tab.tsx`

**Data source:** Fetch from existing `/api/v1/record-counts` route (already created).

**Response shape from /api/v1/record-counts:**

```typescript
{
  grand_total: number          // ~25.4M
  tables_counted: number       // 24
  total_v1_tables: 251
  sync_entities: Array<{ entity: string, v1: number, v2: number }>
  sync_total_v1: number        // ~887K
  categories: {
    core: { tables: number, records: number, breakdown: Record<string, number> }
    fub: { tables: number, records: number, breakdown: Record<string, number> }
    logs: { tables: number, records: number, breakdown: Record<string, number> }
    lambda: { tables: number, records: number, breakdown: Record<string, number> }
  }
  raw_counts: Record<string, number>
  uncounted_tables: number
}
```

**Layout sections:**

1. **Grand Total Hero** — Large number display: "25,402,532 records across 251 tables"

2. **Category Breakdown** — 4 cards (core, fub, logs, lambda) each showing:
   - Category name + table count + total records
   - Percentage of grand total
   - Expandable breakdown showing individual table counts
   - Color-coded bars proportional to record count

3. **Migration Scope Analysis** — Classify records:
   - **Needs Migration** (core: agent, user, transaction, listing, participant, network, contributions) — data that must exist in V2
   - **Operational/Logs** (logs, lambda, audits) — operational data, doesn't need V2 migration
   - **Integration Data** (FUB) — synced separately via FUB integration
   - **Synced** — the 887K records already tracked by V1->V2 sync

4. **V1->V2 Sync Progress** — Table showing 5 sync entities with V1 count, V2 count, delta, and sync percentage.

**Data fetching:** React Query with `staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000` (2 min — these change slowly).

## Acceptance

- [ ] Grand total displayed prominently (~25.4M)
- [ ] 4 category cards with record counts and breakdowns
- [ ] Each category expandable to show individual table counts
- [ ] Migration scope analysis with needs_migration / operational / synced classification
- [ ] V1->V2 sync progress table showing 5 entities
- [ ] Numbers formatted with commas (Intl.NumberFormat)
- [ ] Loading state while API fetches
- [ ] `pnpm build` passes
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes
