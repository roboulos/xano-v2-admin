# fn-8-7q5.6 Align integration test assertions to backend reality

## Description

Update integration test assertions to match the now-pristine backend reality (after orphan cleanup).

**Size:** S
**Files:** test/v2-integration.test.ts

## Current Failing Assertions

| Test               | Expected | Actual (pre-fix) |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| Table count        | ≥193     | 22               |
| Pass rate          | 100%     | 77.27%           |
| Endpoint count     | 200      | 22               |
| Critical endpoints | 100%     | 77.27%           |

## Approach

After orphan cleanup (tasks 1-3):

1. Re-run `pnpm validate:all` to get actual numbers
2. Update assertions to match achieved reality:
   - If 100% achieved → keep expectation at 100%
   - If still gaps → document why and set realistic threshold
3. Ensure all 17 tests pass

## Key Context

- Tests depend on validation scripts in `scripts/validation/`
- After orphan cleanup, expect 100% on references
- Tables should be 223/223 (already passing)

## Acceptance

- [ ] All 17 integration tests pass
- [ ] Assertions match backend reality
- [ ] `pnpm test` exits with 0 failures

## Done summary

TBD
