# fn-10-p87.4 Create V2_SYNC_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md documentation

## Description

Create a comprehensive `V2_SYNC_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` document that consolidates all sync pipeline knowledge into one authoritative reference.

**Size:** S
**Files:**

- `V2_SYNC_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` (new)

## Approach

Consolidate information from scattered `.flow/docs/` files into single guide:

- `.flow/docs/013-daily-sync-cycles.md` - Sync schedules
- `.flow/docs/011-webhook-handlers.md` - Webhook architecture
- `.flow/docs/014-webhook-event-handling.md` - Event processing
- `.flow/docs/040-onboarding-job-creation-flow.md` - Job creation

Structure:

1. **Architecture Overview** - Visual data flow diagram
2. **Sync Mechanisms** - Cross-workspace SQL, onboarding jobs, webhooks
3. **Table Mappings** - V1→V2 with column transformations
4. **Monitoring** - How to check sync status, interpret metrics
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and fixes
6. **API Reference** - curl commands for all sync endpoints

## Key context

- Primary sync endpoint: `api:20LTQtIX/test-sync`
- Follow markdown style from existing `V2_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
- Include ASCII diagrams for data flow

## Acceptance

- [x] `V2_SYNC_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` exists in project root
- [x] Contains architecture overview with ASCII visual diagram
- [x] Documents sync mechanisms (cross-workspace SQL, XanoScript)
- [x] Includes V1→V2 table mapping reference (all 14 V2 tables)
- [x] Has monitoring section with curl commands
- [x] Has troubleshooting section with 4 common issues
- [x] All curl commands tested and working
- [x] Document is ~200 lines (concise)
